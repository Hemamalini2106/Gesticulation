# Gesticulation Mapping

## Project Overview
Gesticulation Mapping is a computer vision-based project designed to recognize and map hand gestures to specific commands or actions. This system leverages image processing and machine learning techniques to interpret human hand movements, enabling more natural and intuitive human-computer interaction.

## Features
- Real-time hand gesture recognition using webcam input  
- Mapping of predefined gestures to corresponding actions or commands  
- Accurate detection and tracking of hand landmarks  
- User-friendly interface for easy interaction and testing  

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.10.x** – Core programming language  
- **OpenCV** – Real-time computer vision and image processing  
- **MediaPipe** (optional if used) – For hand landmark detection  
- **TensorFlow / PyTorch** – For gesture classification model training  
- **NumPy** – Array and numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib** (optional) – Visualization of gesture data  

## How It Works
1. **Capture:** The system captures live video frames from a webcam.  
2. **Detection:** Hand landmarks are detected using OpenCV and MediaPipe (if applicable).  
3. **Feature Extraction:** Key features of the hand gestures are extracted for analysis.  
4. **Classification:** A trained machine learning model classifies the gesture based on extracted features.  
5. **Mapping:** Recognized gestures are mapped to predefined commands or actions, which the system executes or displays.
